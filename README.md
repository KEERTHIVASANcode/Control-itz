It is a mini project which uses IR sensor and Arduino UNO to control LEDs using IR remote.

If we Press buttons in IR remote it will turn ON LED associated with that button if that LED is OFF and turn OFF if it is ON.

Since, IR sensor is Low-Range sensor it will work only around few meters.

It can be used by Patients and Old-aged people to control the Electrical appliances (fans and lights) from their place without moving.
